) i) Implement DML commands for the following schema
Students (StudentID, StudentName, Major)
ii) creating and querying views

1)Schema Definition
CREATE TABLE Students (
  StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  StudentName VARCHAR(50),
  Major VARCHAR(50)
);

 i) DML Commands (Data Manipulation Language)
🔹 1. INSERT – Add new student records
INSERT INTO Students VALUES
(101, 'Tanvi', 'Computer Science'),
(102, 'Ravi', 'Mathematics'),
(103, 'Sneha', 'Physics'),
(104, 'Amit', 'Biology');

 2. UPDATE – Modify a student’s major
UPDATE Students
SET Major = 'Data Science'
WHERE StudentID = 102;

3. DELETE – Remove a student record
DELETE FROM Students
WHERE StudentID = 104;

 4. SELECT – View all student data
SELECT * FROM Students;

2) 1. Create a view of students in science majors
CREATE VIEW ScienceStudents AS
SELECT StudentID, StudentName
FROM Students
WHERE Major IN ('Computer Science', 'Physics', 'Biology');

 2. Query the view
SELECT * FROM ScienceStudents;

 3. Update underlying table via view (if allowed)
UPDATE ScienceStudents
SET StudentName = 'Tanvi R.'
WHERE StudentID = 101;
